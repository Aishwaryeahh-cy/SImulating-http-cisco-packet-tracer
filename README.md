# 🌐 HTTP Simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer

This project shows how **HTTP works in action** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
Instead of reading dry theory, you can *see* how a client asks for a web page and how the server responds — just like when you open Google in your browser!  

---

## ✨ What’s Inside?
- 🖥️ **PC (Client)** – sends an HTTP request  
- 🖧 **Switch/Router** – passes the request  
- 📡 **Server** – hosts a simple website  
- 🔄 **HTTP Response** – server replies with the web page  

---

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the `.pkt` file in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
2. Click on the **PC → Desktop → Web Browser**.  
3. Type the server’s IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.2`).  
4. Boom! 🎉 You’ll see the HTTP request & response in action.
